                <h2>History</h2>
                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>Nigo was born in 1970 on December 23rd. He came from a working-class family, with both parents working lots of hours in order to provide for him and his siblings. This left him to entertain himself with toys and movies. Star Wars was becoming popular worldwide at the time, and Nigo became obsessed with American entertainment. He started collecting toys and figurines at the age of six starting with a plush toy of Donald Duck. This would later turn into one of the biggest collections of pop culture in the world. In his teenage years, Nigo began delving into music and fashion, specifically the genre of Hip-Hop. At 16 years old, he bought a set of turntables with the intention of becoming a DJ. Some of his main influences were New York rapper, LL Cool J, as well as the group Run-DMC, known for their bucket hats, big chains, and baggy clothes. Through his love of Hip-Hop, Nigo became more and more interested in fashion. He began reading fashion magazines like the influential Japanese menâ€™s fashion magazine Popeye, which played a big role in his life later on. However, once he discovered fashion designer, Hiroshi Fujiwara, who had a column in the popular pop-culture magazine, Takarajima, his outlook on fashion changed dramatically. Upon graduating from high school, Nigo moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Bunka Fashion College.</p>
                <h3>Tokyo</h3>
                <p>Although Nigo grew up in the mountainside city of Maebashi in the Gunma Prefecture of Japan, he adjusted to Tokyo quite easily. The bustling nightlife of Tokyo was the perfect environment for Nigo to explore music and fashion. He began DJing in local nightclubs and started making a name for himself both in his music and his unique outfits. However, just like many college students, he spent a little too much time partying rather than studying. He would later go on to state that he learned absolutely nothing from his time at college. What Nigo did gain from his college experience was meeting fellow fashion designer, Jun Takahashi, who was enrolled in the Bunka Fashion College at the same time. They bonded over their shared love of streetwear and would later collaborate on fashion brand NOWHERE. As Nigo gained notoriety in Tokyo, he eventually gained the attention of none other than his idol, Hiroshi Fujiwara. Fujiwara had a keen eye for emerging fashion trends in Tokyo, so he contacted Nigo and offered him a position as his personal assistant. From that point forward, they began working together.</p>
                <h3>Nigo</h3>
                <p>As the story goes, Nigo was at a club one night when someone came up to him and told him that he looked exactly Hiroshi Fujiwara. They called him, Hiroshi Fujiwara Nigo, which translates to Hiroshi Fujiwara number two. Nigo didn't mind being compared to his mentor, so he adopted the nickname and that is how Tomoaki Nagao became known as Nigo. </p>
